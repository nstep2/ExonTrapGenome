# ExonTrapGenome1

This repository contains scripts associated with the publication "The human genome contains over a million autonomous exons." The paper focuses on querying the human genome for splicing potential using deep sequencing of randomly fragmented genomic DNA assayed in an exon trapping reporter assay. The scripts reproduce the analyses presented in the publication.
